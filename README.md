# Shopping cart

This project shows a MPA (multi-page application) that displays a home and a shop page. On the top of each page there is a navigation bar to move between pages. These are the topics learned previously to make this project:

- Testing in react
- Proptypes
- React router
- Styling in react

<br>The shop page includes products fetched from the FakeStore API. These products contain a field where users can write the amount they desire and buttons to adjust quantity. Also, they is a button next to each product to send them to the shopping cart. This shopping cart displays the correct amount of items to buy.
